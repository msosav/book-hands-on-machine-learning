This is the Jupyter notebooks for the book. The official GitHub repository for the book can be found [here](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3/blob/main/README.md?plain=1).

## How to use these notebooks?

Run the notebooks on your local machine, you can clone this repository, install the required dependencies, and start a Jupyter notebook server. To do this, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository by running:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/msosav/book-hands-on-machine-learning
   cd book-hands-on-machine-learning
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment by running:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Jupyter notebook server by running:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Or if you are using Visual Studio Code, you can open the notebooks directly in the editor.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to select the Python interpreter in the virtual environment you created in step 2 in the kernel of the Jupyter notebook.
